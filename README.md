This is sanitized code (due to NDA requirements) from a project for a startup. 

## What the code does:
Allows you to customize "off the shelf embeddings" via transfer learning training tasks.

## In my case: 
Word2Vec was customized via a multilabel/multficlass classification problem to predict "tags/topics" in an email corpus.
The customized embeddings was then used to improve perfromance on a different classification task using the same corpus.
